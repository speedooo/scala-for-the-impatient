# Chapter 01 Exercise 04

## Question

Scala lets you multiply a string with a number—try out `"crazy" * 3` in the REPL.
What does this operation do? Where can you find it in Scaladoc?

## Solution

Return the current string concatenated 3 times.

See value member `*` in [StringOps](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.collection.immutable.StringOps).
