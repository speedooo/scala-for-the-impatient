# Chapter 07 Exercise 04

## Question

Why do you think the Scala language designers provided the `package object` syntax instead of simply letting you add functions and variables to a package?

## Solution

A package can contain classes, objects, and traits, but not the definitions of functions or variables. That’s an unfortunate limitation of the Java virtual machine.
