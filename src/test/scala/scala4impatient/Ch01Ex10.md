# Chapter 01 Exercise 10

## Question

What do the `take`, `drop`, `takeRight`, and `dropRight` string functions do? What advantage or disadvantage do they have over using `substring`?

## Solution

`take`: Selects first n elements.
`drop`: Selects all elements except first n ones.
`takeRight`: Selects last n elements.
`dropRight`: Selects all elements except last n ones.

These functions take advantage of the `IndexedSeqOptimized` trait which optimizes the implementation of several methods under the assumption of fast random access, `substring` comes from `java.lang.String`.
