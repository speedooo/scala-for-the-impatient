# Chapter 08 Exercise 09

## Question

In the Creature class of Section 8.10, “Construction Order and Early Definitions,” on page 92, replace val range with a def.

# What happens when you also use a def in the Ant subclass?
# What happens when you use a val in the subclass? Why?

## Solution

# Like in Java.
# Subclass has a private field. Getter overrides the superclass method.
